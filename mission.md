## Our Mission

Advance quantitative methods in applied geophysics.

## Our Approach

Scientific Excellence & Innovation
: We advance numerical methods for geophysical simulations and inversions and include machine learning to extract insights from geophysical data. Our group facilitates the integration of data and information between geoscientific disciplines.

Societal Impact
: We recognize the crucial role of applied geophysics and numerical computing in addressing environmental, geological, and societal challenges, and we prioritize research with real-world applications.

Open Science
: We promote open-science principles and strive to create an open-source foundation for computational geophysics. We share our research findings and methodologies openly with the global scientific community to accelerate scientific progress. Open practices bring together experts from different backgrounds and perspectives, enriching our research and broadening our collective impact.

Education & Outreach
: We train the next generation of highly qualified geoscientists and practitioners. We support open education, workshops, and international initiatives to improve the understanding the role of geophysics to help solve earth and environmental challenges.
